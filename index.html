			<h2>Bio</h2>
			<p>As of the creation of this site, I am currently 20 years old I was born
				in London Ontario, and I spent the early years of my childhood living in
				the country outside of London moving back to London for the latter half
				of elementary school. I have traveled to many countries, all over
				the US, Cuba, England, Germany, Panama to name a few. In the past to
				wanted to be an architect, but in my last year in high school,
				I took a media arts class, and we when we got into animation I knew what
				I wanted to do. I looked for an animation course, and I saw the advanced
				3D animation course, so I signed up for graphic design at Fanshawe, and
				the workload hit me like a truck. I barely managed to scrape by a
				passing grade. Then during summer break, I was referred to taking
				Interactive Media Design, and here I am.</p>
